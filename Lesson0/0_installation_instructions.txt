How to Install Python

STEP 1
======

Go to https://www.python.org/
Click "Downloads"
Download a version of Python for your operating system
 - I recommend learning Python 3 instead of Python 2
 - Personally, I tend to be one minor release behind the latest minor version
 - We have Python 3.5 at work so anything newer is an upgrade
Run the Python installer
Reboot if necessary



STEP 2
======

Windows
-------
Run cmd.exe
Type "python" (w/out quotes)
This opens an interactive session of the Python interpreter
 - You can type Python commands in this session
 - For example, try typing "pi=3.14159; print(pi)" (w/out quotes) and then press Enter
 - You can also type "help()" (w/out quotes) to enter the Python help utility
The very fist line printed by the interpreter shows the version
 - This should match the version you just installed
Type "exit()" (w/out quotes) to exit the interpreter
Close the command window


macOS (formerly OS X)
---------------------
Launch the terminal
Type "python3" (w/out quotes)
 - Apple includes an installation of Python 2 by default, DO NOT try to uninstall it!
 - You can run multiple version of Python side-by-side as long as you're clear about 
   which version of Python you're telling the system to use
   (hence why we use the "python3" command)
This opens an interactive session of the Python interpreter
 - You can type Python commands in this session
 - For example, try typing "pi=3.14159; print(pi)" (w/out quotes) and then press return
 - You can also type "help()" (w/out quotes) to enter the Python help utility
The very fist line printed by the interpreter shows the version
 - This should match the version you just installed
Type "exit()" (w/out quotes) to exit the interpreter
Close the terminal



STEP 3 (optional)
=================

>> Installing SciPi provides access to useful packages such as pandas and Matplotlib

Go to https://www.scipy.org/
Click "Install"
Use the pip installation instructions to install SciPy
 - Note for macOS users: Be sure to use "python3" instead of "python" in the command 
   so that SciPy is installed for the desired version of Python
Reboot if necessary



STEP 4
======

Run the sample code by following the instructions below


Windows
-------
Run cmd.exe
Navigate to the directory of this lesson
Type "python sample.py" (w/out quotes) and then press Enter
The program *should* run...
Close the command window


macOS (formerly OS X)
---------------------
Launch the terminal
Navigate to the directory of this lesson
Type "python3 sample.py" (w/out quotes) and then press return
The program *should* run...
Close the terminal



FINAL NOTES
===========

Installing Python will install IDLE as the default Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for Python
 - IDLE is functional, but ugly
PyCharm is a popular (and free) IDE for Python
 - https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
For a bare bones approach, you can use a text editor and the command line for Python development
 - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ (Notepad++ is a free and more powerful alternative to Notepad for Windows)
 - https://macromates.com/ (TextMate is a free and more powerful alternative to TextEdit for macOS)
My personal favorite editor is VS Code
 - https://code.visualstudio.com/ (free, open source, and multi-platform)
I recommend trying a few out and picking what you like best
