# The objective of this exercise is to become familiar 
# with file operations in Python

# I recommend reading this first
# https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp

# Open the 'aircraft_carriers.txt' file, read it, and parse its contents into a Python dictionary
# The dictionary should match the format of the dictionary in the previous lesson



# Once you have the file loaded into a dictionary, generate a report of only decommissioned carriers
# Format the report as a table with column headings
#NOTE: The '\t' special character is the Tab character
# Write the report to the file 'decomm_report.txt'



# Congratulations! You have completed the lesson on file operations
#NOTE: You've also written a parser script
#NOTE: You can apply these same principles to post-processing computer output files
