# The objective of this exercise is to become familiar 
# with working with while loops in Python

# I recommend reading this first
# https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/introduction.html#first-steps-towards-programming

# Using a while loop, calculate the largest number in the Fibonacci Sequence 
# that is less than or equal to one million
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number
# Print both the number and its position in the sequence



# Here is a list of aircraft carriers
aircraft_carriers = ['USS NIMITZ',\
                     'USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER',\
                     'USS CARL VINSON',\
                     'USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT',\
                     'USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN',\
                     'USS GEORGE WASHINGTON',\
                     'USS JOHN C. STENNIS',\
                     'USS HARRY S. TRUMAN',\
                     'USS RONALD REAGAN',\
                     'USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH',\
                     'USS GERALD R. FORD']

#NOTE: The '\' character breaks input across lines
#NOTE: This can be useful to improve the readability of code

# Using a while loop, iterate over the entire list and create a dictionary 
# of ship names using hull numbers as keys (e.g., {68:'USS NIMITZ', ... })
# Only include ships with hull numbers <= 77
#NOTE: The '+=' operator is useful for incrementing counter variables



# Congratulations! You have completed the lesson on while loops
