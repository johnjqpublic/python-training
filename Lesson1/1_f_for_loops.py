# The objective of this exercise is to become familiar 
# with working with for loops in Python

# I recommend reading this first
# https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements

# Using a for loop, calculate the one millionth number in the Fibonacci Sequence
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number



# Here is a list of aircraft carriers
aircraft_carriers = ['USS NIMITZ',\
                     'USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER',\
                     'USS CARL VINSON',\
                     'USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT',\
                     'USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN',\
                     'USS GEORGE WASHINGTON',\
                     'USS JOHN C. STENNIS',\
                     'USS HARRY S. TRUMAN',\
                     'USS RONALD REAGAN',\
                     'USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH',\
                     'USS GERALD R. FORD']

#NOTE: The '\' character breaks input across lines
#NOTE: This can be useful to improve the readability of code

# Using a for loop, iterate over the entire list and create a dictionary 
# of ship names using hull numbers as keys (e.g., {68:'USS NIMITZ', ... })



# Congratulations! You have completed the lesson on for loops
