# The objective of this exercise is to become familiar

# Here is a dictionary of aircraft carriers
# The 'key' is the hull number and the 'value' is the name
aircraft_carriers = {68:'USS NIMITZ',\
                     69:'USS DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER',\
                     70:'USS CARL VINSON',\
                     71:'USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT',\
                     72:'USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN',\
                     73:'USS GEORGE WASHINGTON',\
                     74:'USS JOHN C. STENNIS',\
                     75:'USS HARRY S. TRUMAN',\
                     76:'USS RONALD REAGAN',\
                     77:'USS GEORGE H. W. BUSH'}

# NOTE: The '\' character breaks input across lines
# NOTE: This can be useful to improve the readability of code

# Iterate over the dictionary and print each entry
# along with it's hull number (e.g., "USS NIMITZ (CVN 68)")
# >> Only print ships with even hull numbers



# Iterate over the dictionary and print each entry
# along with it's hull number (e.g., "USS NIMITZ (CVN 68)")
# >> Only print ships with middle names AND odd hull numbers



# Congratulations! You have completed the lesson on flow control
